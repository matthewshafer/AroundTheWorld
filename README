I just started work on this, so there aren't any real features yet and a bunch of stuff will probably change!


What this aims to do is make it easy to do distance calculations between two points.
Currently all that is supported is signed decimal latitude/longitude points

You currently can't change the units that it returns.  I plan on changing that really soon.
